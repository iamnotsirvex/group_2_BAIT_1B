<h1 class="news_1">Duterte, the former president will run for Davao City mayor anew</h1>
<p class="article_duterte">
    Rodrigo Duterte, the former president, has chosen to run for office once more. Before taking office as president of the Philippines in 2016, he served as mayor of Davao City for a number of years. This time, he hopes to retake that position. Additionally, Duterte declared that he would run, perhaps in partnership with his son, Sebastian Duterte, the current mayor. In response to requests for him to run for senator in the 2025 midterm elections, Duterte stated that he is too old to undertake a national campaign. The elder Duterte, Sebastian, and Davao City Representative Paolo Duterte are all planning to seek for Senate seats, according to a statement made earlier by his daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte. Duterte, however, refuted this, claiming that Sara was merely kidding. "Anong gagawin namin sa Senate...Anong gagawin namin doon?" he exclaimed.Additionally, he asserted that he is "not inclined" to get back into politics, claiming that after his term ends in 2022, he will no longer have the financial means or political capital to do so. "Hindi na ako babalik ng politika. Tapos na po ako. Laos na ako. Wala na akong panggastos, wala na lahat. Ang naiwan sa akin siguro yabang," Duterte stated.
